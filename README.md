## Notes

This prework project allowed me to refresh my knowledge of HTML/CSS and gain more experience with JavaScript features such as template literals, functions, filter, map, reduce, destructuring and spread operators, logic evaluation, as well as using JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements.

I have implemented the search function and it filters correctly but for some reason it is not working on the website with the text box.
